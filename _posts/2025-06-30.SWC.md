# Introduction

As more projects adopt **Vite** instead of the traditional **Create React App (CRA)**, I noticed a common addition in React project setups: the label **“+ SWC”**. This raised a question for me—what does this “+ SWC” actually mean, and why is it becoming popular?

## What is SWC?

A quick search revealed that **SWC** stands for **Speedy Web Compiler**. It's a super-fast JavaScript compiler written in **Rust**. Essentially, it's a modern alternative to **Babel**.

Interestingly, while SWC is primarily a compiler, it also offers **bundling** capabilities similar to tools like **Webpack**.  
So, SWC isn't just a compiler—it’s more accurately described as a **Rust-based platform** for JavaScript tooling.

## Why is SWC so fast?

SWC's superior performance primarily stems from its implementation in **Rust**, a systems programming language designed with efficient **parallel processing** capabilities.

In contrast to **Babel**, which is written in JavaScript and operates on a **single-threaded** model, SWC leverages Rust’s concurrency features to compile multiple files **simultaneously**, significantly improving build times.

According to the official documentation, SWC can achieve speeds up to **20 times faster** than Babel when running on a single thread, and up to **70 times faster** when utilizing a multi-core environment with four CPU cores.
